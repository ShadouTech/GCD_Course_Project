The mean averages of a subset of the original Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0 are calculated. The url of the source data is below.

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The values shown are the averages of the original values and grouped by activity and subjectid.

They are accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals. 'xyz' refers to 3-dimensional axis signals from the X, Y, and Z directions.

For each record in the dataset it is provided:
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
- Its activity label.
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
