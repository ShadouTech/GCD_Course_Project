The values shown are mean calculations variables from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0. Url is below

The run_analysis script outputs the original data into a tidy one. The unzipped data files from the original study (train, test, analysis.txt, etc) must be inside the local folder (in otherwords take them out of the UCI folder).

The train and test sets are merged and the mean of the standard deviations for each activity variable are calculated.
